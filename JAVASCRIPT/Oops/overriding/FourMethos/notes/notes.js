// <!-- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages, including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python. -->

// <!-- Class templates are used as a blueprint to create individual objects. -->

// <!-- OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures
// Reusable, OOP objects can be used across programs
// Polymorphism allows for class-specific behavior
// Easier to debug, classes often contain all applicable information to them
// Securely protects sensitive information through encapsulation -->


// <!-- Grouping related information together to form a class structure makes the code shorter and easier to maintain. -->

//  <!-- attributes include name & birthday, -->
//  <!-- Attributes are the information that is stored. Attributes are defined in the Class template./ -->
//  <!-- while methods include bark() and updateAttendance(). -->
//  <!-- Methods represent behaviors. Methods perform actions; methods might return information about an object or update an object’s data. The method’s code is defined in the class definition. -->
